    //     From Zero to Full Stack – My Web Development Journey

    //     <p>
    //       During the COVID pandemic, I was in my first year of honours. Classes
    //       had just started, but after two months, everything got locked down.
    //       Sitting at home, I thought,{" "}
    //       <i>“I need to do something productive.”</i> I first tried learning{" "}
    //       <b>logo design</b>, but quickly realized design just wasn’t my thing,
    //       so I moved on.
    //     </p>
    //     <p>
    //       Programming had always fascinated me since my higher secondary days,
    //       so I thought, why not try web development? I started learning on my
    //       own, using free resources like YouTube, and built a few small projects
    //       to practice.
    //     </p>

    //     <p>
    //       After a while, I met one of my seniors from school, a web developer,
    //       who suggested I join a bootcamp to learn in a more guided environment.
    //       I asked my mom for the fees, and thankfully, she agreed. In January
    //       2022, I joined a bootcamp.
    //     </p>

    //     <p>
    //       The bootcamp was intense, but it was exactly what I needed. The
    //       deadline-focused environment helped me grasp the basics of full-stack
    //       MERN development in just four months. Feeling motivated, I set a
    //       personal challenge: <i>get a job within four months</i>.
    //     </p>

    //     <p>
    //       Luck was on my side! I landed an internship at{" "}
    //       <b>Banao Technologies</b>, Karnataka, India, as a React.js developer.
    //       There, I learned the <b>basics of React</b> and how to optimize
    //       performance by building real-world projects. My internship was
    //       extended from six months to nine, giving me even more hands-on
    //       experience.
    //     </p>
    //     <p>
    //       Next, I joined <b>Adztronaut</b>, a company in West Bengal, as a{" "}
    //       <b>MERN stack developer</b>. This was where I really got to stretch my
    //       skills. I{" "}
    //       <b>
    //         built the entire GeetBazaar music distribution platform from scratch
    //       </b>{" "}
    //       — artist and admin dashboards, release workflows, royalty tracking,
    //       and account management. Doing it all myself was challenging, but it
    //       taught me the power of building things end-to-end and owning the
    //       process.
    //     </p>
    //     <p>
    //       After that, I did a{" "}
    //       <b>Software Engineering Internship at CloudLumos</b> (Nov 2023 – Feb
    //       2024), where I helped with{" "}
    //       <b>API integrations and modular component development</b>, while also
    //       improving UI workflows and state management.
    //     </p>

    //     <p>
    //       Then I joined a local company, <b>Raddito</b>, as a full-stack
    //       developer. Here, I learned about <b>perfectly designed websites</b>,
    //       responsiveness, animations, and performance optimization. During my
    //       time there, I built <b>over 20 web templates</b>, which really
    //       solidified my skills on both frontend and backend.
    //     </p>

    //     <p>
    //       Looking back, this journey—from fumbling through design to building
    //       full-stack web apps and managing entire projects—has been full of
    //       challenges, learning, and growth. It taught me the importance of
    //       <b>persistence, curiosity, and believing in yourself</b>. And even
    //       today, I’m still learning, still building, and still excited for the
    //       next project.

          From Zero to Full Stack – My Web Development Journey
        </h1>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          During the COVID pandemic, I was in my first year of honours. Classes
          had barely started when everything suddenly shut down. Sitting at home
          with too much time and too many questions, I kept thinking,
          <em class="text-white">
            “I need to do something productive with my life.”
          </em>
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          I initially tried learning logo design, but very quickly realized that
          design wasn’t really my strength. What did excite me, though, was
          programming. Ever since my higher secondary days, I had been curious
          about how websites actually worked. So I decided to give web
          development a real shot.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          With no money for paid courses, I started learning on my own using
          free resources—mostly YouTube. I built small projects, broke things,
          fixed them again, and slowly started understanding how the web works.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          At one point, I reconnected with a senior from my school who was
          already working as a web developer. He suggested that I join a
          bootcamp to learn in a more structured, deadline-driven environment. I
          spoke to my mom about the fees, and thankfully, she supported me. In
          January 2022, I joined a full-stack MERN bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          The bootcamp was intense—but exactly what I needed. In just four
          months, I built a solid foundation in full-stack MERN development. The
          pressure of deadlines pushed me to grow faster than I ever had before.
          After finishing, I challenged myself:{" "}
          <strong class="text-white">get a job within four months.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          That challenge paid off. In July 2022, I landed a React Developer
          internship at <strong class="text-white">Banao Technologies</strong>{" "}
          in Karnataka, India. There, I worked on real-world React applications,
          built reusable UI components, integrated REST APIs, and improved
          front-end state management. My internship was extended from six months
          to nine months due to performance.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          In February 2023, I joined{" "}
          <strong class="text-white">Adztronaut</strong> as a MERN Stack
          Developer. This was a major turning point in my career. I worked on
          multiple front-end multipage websites and built a complete{" "}

            music distribution platform (GeetBazaar)

          from scratch— including dashboards, release workflows, royalty
          tracking, account management, and an Ollama-based AI chatbot.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white-2 leading-relaxed">
          Alongside this, I completed a{" "}

            Software Engineering Internship at CloudLumos
          </strong>{" "}
          (Nov 2023 – Feb 2024), where I assisted with API integrations, built
          modular components, improved UI workflows, and optimized state
          management for better user experience.

          In January 2024, I joined{" "}

          Looking back, my journey—from experimenting with design, to learning
