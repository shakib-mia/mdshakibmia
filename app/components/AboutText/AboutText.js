        From Zero to Full Stack – My Web Development Journey
      </h1>
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          During the COVID pandemic, I was in my first year of honours. Classes
          had just started, but after two months, everything got locked down.
          Sitting at home, I thought,{" "}
          <i>“I need to do something productive.”</i> I first tried learning{" "}
          <b>logo design</b>, but quickly realized design just wasn’t my thing,
          so I moved on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming had always fascinated me since my higher secondary days,
          so I thought, why not try web development? I started learning on my
          own, using free resources like YouTube, and built a few small projects
          to practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a while, I met one of my seniors from school, a web developer,
          who suggested I join a bootcamp to learn in a more guided environment.
          I asked my mom for the fees, and thankfully, she agreed. In January
          2022, I joined a bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bootcamp was intense, but it was exactly what I needed. The
          deadline-focused environment helped me grasp the basics of full-stack
          MERN development in just four months. Feeling motivated, I set a
          personal challenge: <i>get a job within four months</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Luck was on my side! I landed an internship at{" "}
          <b>Banao Technologies</b>, Karnataka, India, as a React.js developer.
          There, I learned the <b>basics of React</b> and how to optimize
          performance by building real-world projects. My internship was
          extended from six months to nine, giving me even more hands-on
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I joined <b>Adztronaut</b>, a company in West Bengal, as a{" "}
          <b>MERN stack developer</b>. This was where I really got to stretch my
          skills. I{" "}
          <b>
            built the entire GeetBazaar music distribution platform from scratch
          </b>{" "}
          — artist and admin dashboards, release workflows, royalty tracking,
          and account management. Doing it all myself was challenging, but it
          taught me the power of building things end-to-end and owning the
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, I did a{" "}
          <b>Software Engineering Internship at CloudLumos</b> (Nov 2023 – Feb
          2024), where I helped with{" "}
          <b>API integrations and modular component development</b>, while also
          improving UI workflows and state management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I joined a local company, <b>Raddito</b>, as a full-stack
          developer. Here, I learned about <b>perfectly designed websites</b>,
          responsiveness, animations, and performance optimization. During my
          time there, I built <b>over 20 web templates</b>, which really
          solidified my skills on both frontend and backend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back, this journey—from fumbling through design to building
          full-stack web apps and managing entire projects—has been full of
          challenges, learning, and growth. It taught me the importance of
          <b>persistence, curiosity, and believing in yourself</b>. And even
          today, I’m still learning, still building, and still excited for the
          next project.
